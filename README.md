# Prisma Blog

To learn `Prisma` and `Type ORM`, I created this blog project.

Be aware that this project is not production ready. It is just a playground to learn `Prisma` and `Type ORM`.

# Setup

You can change this to `monorepo` if you want to. But this is just a budget project to learn new things.

```bash
cd client && pnpm install && pnpm run dev
cd server && pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```
